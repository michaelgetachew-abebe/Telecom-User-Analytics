# Telecom-User-Analytics
This repository is a real world problem based repository done partial fullfillment of the week 1 of my AI/Web 3 Engineering track at 10 Academy. In this project I was given a dataset generated by a telecommunication company and this dataset was generated by the system components inside the industry. The dataset contained several network descriptor parameters out of which several insights can be overseen about the current state of the company.
The company is called TellCo and it is based in the Republic of Pefkakia. My client was an Investor who had specialized in buying undervalued assets. This investor's due deligence on all purchases includes a detailed analysis of the data that underlies the business to try to understand the fundamentals of the business and especially to identify opportunities to drive profitability by changing the focus which products or services are being offered.
In this task my employer wanted me to prvide a report to analyse opportunities for growth and make recommendations on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling.
I have performed this task by analysing a telecommunication dataset and provided a web based dashboard and written a report.
